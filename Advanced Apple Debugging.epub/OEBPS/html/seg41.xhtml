<h1 class="segment-chapter">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Wow! You made it all the way to this conclusion! You either must have jumped straight to this page or you’re way more masochistic than I could have anticipated.
</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about the projects or concepts in this book, or have any stories to tell from your own debugging adventures, please stop by our forums at <a href="http://forums.raywenderlich.com">http://forums.raywenderlich.com</a>.
</p>
<p>From here, you have a few paths to explore depending on what you found most interesting in this book.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If exploring code in Python to make better debugging scripts interests you, then you might want to see what other modules exist in Python 2.7 (or the equivalent Python version LLDB has) to see how far down the rabbit hole you can go. You can find the list of modules in Python 2.7 here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/py-modindex.html">https://docs.python.org/2/py-modindex.html</a> or hunt down one of the many books on Amazon about Python.
</p></li>

<li>
<p>If reverse engineering Apple internals interests you, I would strongly recommend you check out <em>Jonathan Levin</em>’s work on anything related to Apple, namely his updated books like <em>MacOS and iOS Internals, Volume III: Security </em><em>&amp;</em><em> Insecurity</em> at <a href="http://www.newosxbook.com/">http://www.newosxbook.com/</a>.
</p></li>

<li>
<p>Also check out <a href="https://twitter.com/snakeninny">@snakeninny</a>&apos;s free book, <a href="https://github.com/iosre/iOSAppReverseEngineering/">https://github.com/iosre/iOSAppReverseEngineering/</a>
</p></li>

<li>
<p>If more generic reverse engineering/hacking interests you, then you might be interested in <em>Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition</em> by <em>Jon Erickson</em> at <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/hacking2.htm">https://www.nostarch.com/hacking2.htm</a>.
</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If you want the equivalent of an LLDB newsletter, I would recommend to (nicely!) stalk <em>Jim Ingham</em>’s activity on Stack Overflow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2465073/jim-ingham">http://stackoverflow.com/users/2465073/jim-ingham</a>. He works on LLDB at Apple, and combing through his responses on StackOverflow will give you a tremendous amount of insight into LLDB. In addition, check out the LLDB archives <a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/lldb-dev/">http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/lldb-dev/</a>. There&apos;s a lot to dig through, but you can find some incredibly useful hidden gems from the LLDB authors.
</p></li>

<li>
<p>If DTrace interested you, check out <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/dtracebook/index.html">http://www.brendangregg.com/dtracebook/index.html</a>. This book will cover a much wider range of how to use DTrace than what I&apos;ve discussed.

</ul>

<p>And finally... here&apos;s a diff of Jake when this book project began in June 2016 to when my editors finally ripped this book from my cold, lifeless fingers.

<p>Yeah, I am totally that annoying dude on Facebook that constantly posts pictures of his children and/or dogs :]
