<h2 class="segment-team-bios">About the author</h2>
<div class="author-figure"><img src="graphics/img1.png"  alt="" title="" /></div>
<p><em>Derek Selander</em> is the author of this book. His interest with debugging grew when he started exploring how to make (the now somewhat obsolete) Xcode plugins and iOS tweaks on his jailbroken phone, both of which required exploring and augmenting programs with no source available. In his free time, he enjoys pickup soccer, guitar, and playing with his two doggies, Jake &amp; Squid.
